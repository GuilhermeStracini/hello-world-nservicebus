## Overview

This repository provides examples and best practices for using NServiceBus to build robust, distributed, and scalable applications. It covers core concepts like messaging patterns, reliable communication, and integration with various transport and persistence mechanisms.

---

## Features

- **Message-Based Communication**:
  - Learn to implement asynchronous, decoupled communication using commands, events, and messages.

- **Transport Integration**:
  - Examples using popular transports like RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, and MSMQ.

- **Persistence**:
  - Implement message persistence with databases like SQL Server or NoSQL stores like MongoDB.

- **Reliability**:
  - Understand retry policies, error handling, and message auditing.

- **Scalability**:
  - Learn to scale services effectively with NServiceBus tools and configuration.
